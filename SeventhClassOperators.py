"""Python Operators"""
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values
# 10 + 5 -> 10 & 5 are operands, + is an operator

"""Opeartors"""
# 1. Arithmetic Operators
# 2. Assignment Operators
# 3. Comparison Operators
# 4. Logical Operators
# 5. Identity Operators
# 6. Membership Operators
# 7. Bitwise Operators

""" Arithmetic Operators -> +,-,*,/,%,**,// """
# Addition - (+)
# x = 5
# y = 2
# print(x+y)

# Subtraction - (-)
# print(x-y)

# Multiplication - (*)
# print(x*y)

# Division - (/) - Float O/P
# print(x/y)

# Modulus - (%) (To get the remainder)
# print(x%y)

# Exponentiation or Power
# print(x**y) # 5 to the power of 2 -> 25

# Floor Division - (Integer Output)
# print(x//y)
